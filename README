SFML Data Structures Visualization Project
Overview
This project is a graphical visualization of several fundamental data structures implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The program provides a visual representation of the
following data structures:

Linked List
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Heap (Max Heap)
Red-Black Tree
Stack
Priority Queue (Max-Heap)
Key Features:
Interactive Menu: The user can select a data structure from the main menu to visualize its operations.
Visualization: Each data structure is visualized graphically using shapes (circles, rectangles) and lines connecting parent-child relationships.
Insertion Operations: Data structures support insertion of nodes, and the visual representation updates in real-time.
SFML Graphics: The project uses SFML for graphical rendering and event handling, providing an interactive and dynamic display.
